The '''killer whale''' or '''orca''' (''Orcinus orca'') is a [[toothed whale]] belonging to the [[oceanic dolphin]] family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt [[marine mammal]]s such as [[Pinniped|seals]] and other species of dolphin. They have been known to attack [[baleen whale]] calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are [[apex predator]]s, as no animal preys on them.  A [[cosmopolitan species]], they can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic regions]] to tropical seas, absent only from the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, and some areas of the Arctic Ocean.

Killer whales are highly [[Social animal|social]]; some populations are composed of [[matrilineal]] family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of [[animal culture]].

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] assesses the orca's [[conservation status]] as [[data deficient]] because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are [[Species problem|separate species]]. Some local populations are considered [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to prey depletion, [[habitat loss]], pollution (by [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]), capture for [[marine mammal park]]s, and [[Commercial fishing#Environmental Risk|conflicts with human fisheries]]. In late 2005, the [[southern resident killer whale]]s, which swim in [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington state]] waters, were placed on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species of mammals and birds|U.S. Endangered Species list]].

Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans, but there have been cases of [[Killer whale attacks on humans#Captive orca attacks|captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers]] at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.

The killer whale is one of 35 species in the [[Delphinidae|oceanic dolphin family]], which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=19}} Although it has morphological similarities with the [[false killer whale]], the [[pygmy killer whale]] and the [[pilot whale]]s, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus ''[[Orcaella]]''.<ref name=leduc>

===Common names===
Although the term "orca" is increasingly used, English-speaking scientists most often use the traditional name "killer whale". The genus name ''Orcinus'' means "of the kingdom of the dead",{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=69}} or "belonging to [[Orcus]]".<ref>[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/killer-whale/scientific-classification.htm Killer Whales. Scientific Classification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815082034/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/killer-whale/scientific-classification.htm |date=August 15, 2012 }}, Seaworld.org, September 23, 2010, Retrieved September 9, 2010.</ref>
[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] originally used ''orca'' (pl. ''orcae'') for these animals, possibly borrowing [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄρυξ}} (''óryx''), which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, "orca" has steadily grown in popularity. The term "orca" is preferred by some as it avoids the negative connotations of "killer",<ref>Olsen, Ken.

They are sometimes referred to as "blackfish", a name also used for other whale species. "Grampus" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of "grampus" should not be confused with the genus ''[[Grampus (genus)|Grampus]]'', whose only member is [[Risso's dolphin]].<ref>Leatherwood, Stephen and Larry J. Hobbs (1988).

Three types have been documented in the [[Antarctic]].

There are seven identified [[ecotype]]s inhabiting isolated [[ecological niche]]s. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on [[minke whale]]s, the second on seals and penguins, and the third on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations described above. Research has supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.<ref name="nyt2010">{{cite news|first=NICHOLAS |last=WADE |date=April 26, 2010 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27whale.html?src=sch&pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Cracking Orca's Code: It Comes in Several Types}}</ref>

The killer whale's teeth are very strong, and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place, while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements.{{sfn|Heptner|Nasimovich|Bannikov|Hoffmann|1996|p=683}}

An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=1–27}}

In the Antarctic, killer whales range up to the edge of the [[pack ice]] and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open [[Lead (sea ice)|leads]] much like [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]] whales in the Arctic.

Fish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Greenland]] sea specialize in [[herring]] and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. [[Salmon]] account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet, including 65% of large, fatty [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]].{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=18}} [[Chum salmon]] are also eaten, but smaller [[Sockeye salmon|sockeye]] and [[pink salmon]] are not a significant food item.{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|2006}} Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats {{convert|227|kg|lb}} each day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/animals/creaturefeature/orca/|title=National Geographic creature feature|author=Hughes, Catherine D.|accessdate=July 25, 2007}}</ref> While salmon are usually hunted by an individual whale or a small group, herring are often caught using [[carousel feeding]]: the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides.

Hunting a large whale usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally attack young or weak animals; however, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother to exhaustion. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, drowning it by keeping it from surfacing. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2001.tb01000.x|author=Pitman, Robert L.|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/507/ |title=Killer Whale Predation on Sperm Whales: Observations and Implications|journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=17|issue=3|pages=494–507|year=2001|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales.

[[History of whaling|Prior to the advent of industrial whaling]], great whales may have been the major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of [[Harpoon cannon|exploding harpoons]] indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.<ref name="EMM2009">{{cite book|last=Estes|first=James|editor=Perrin, William F.|others=Wursig, Bernd & Thewissen, J.

Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of [[Earless seal|seal]], [[sea lion]] and [[fur seal]]. [[Walrus]]es and [[sea otter]]s are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=45}} Sea lions are killed by [[head-butting]] or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Albatrosses associating with killer whales.JPG|thumb|Association of killer whales and [[black-browed albatross]]es]]
Day-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales frequently engage in [[Whale surfacing behavior|surface behaviour]] such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging [[parasite]]s, or [[Play (animal behavior)|play]]. [[Spyhopping]] is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=64}}

===Social structure===
[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|left|A pair of killer whales in a transient population in Northwest Pacific]]
Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Only [[elephant]]s and [[higher primate]]s live in comparably complex [[social structure]]s.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=35}} Due to orcas' complex social bonds, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep [[Captive killer whales|them in captivity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ |title=Keep Whales Wild |publisher=Keep Whales Wild |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216065407/http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups. Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on [[matriline]]s consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, a killer whale named [[Luna (Orca)|Luna]], no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}}

[[File:Orca 2.jpg|thumb|left|Killer whales, like this one near Alaska, commonly [[Whale surfacing behaviour|breach]], often lifting their entire bodies out of the water.|alt=A killer whale leaping out of the water is about to land on its back.]]

Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} [[DNA]] testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39}} Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.{{efn|In the northeast Pacific, three communities of fish-eating killer whales have been identified: the southern community (one clan, three pods, 90 killer whales as of 2006), the northern community (three clans, 16 pods, 214 killer whales as of 2000), and the south Alaskan community (two clans, 11 pods, 211 killer whales as of 2000).}}

Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=13}} As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14}}

{{See also|Whale sound}}
Like all [[cetaceans]], killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.<ref name=noaa/>

Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20}} Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum [[salmon]], species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the [[marine mammal]] prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20}} They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.

Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=15–16}}

To avoid [[inbreeding]], males mate with females from other pods. [[Gestation period|Gestation]] varies from 15 to 18 months. {{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=33}} Mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years.

In 2008, the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale's [[conservation status]] from [[conservation dependent]] to [[data deficient]], recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, [[endangered species]].<ref name=iucn/> [[overfishing|Depletion of prey species]], [[Marine pollution|pollution]], large-scale [[oil spill]]s, and [[Disturbance (ecology)|habitat disturbance]] caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats.<ref name=iucn/>

Like other animals at the highest [[trophic level]]s, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from [[bioaccumulation]] of toxins, including [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs).{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99}} European [[harbour seal]]s have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals.{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99}} Blubber samples in the [[Arctic Norway|Norwegian Arctic]] show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and [[brominated flame-retardant]]s than in [[polar bear]]s. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize [[blubber]] for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.

Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering [[Marine mammals and sonar#Naval sonar-linked incidents|U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales]].

The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars.<ref name = Pickrell/> "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometres) distant, Balcomb said."<ref name = Pickrell/> The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise.<ref name = Pickrell/> Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and [[CAT scan]]s of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with [[decompression sickness]].<ref name = Pickrell/>

Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the [[Species at Risk Act]] in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the [[British Columbia Coast]] and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats.<ref name = CBC>{{cite news|title=Ottawa Sued over Lack of Legislation to Protect B.C.

In [[Western culture]]s, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} The first written description of a killer whale was given by [[Pliny the Elder]] ''circa'' AD 70, who wrote, "Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other kinds of whale]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming."<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]].

Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Iceland]], the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in [[Puget Sound]] for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=41}} The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine guns, rockets, and [[depth charge]]s.<ref>Killer Whales Destroyed: VP-7 Accomplishes Special Task, ''Naval Aviation News'', December 1956, p. 19.

===Modern Western attitudes===
{{See also|Killer whales in popular culture}}
[[File:Woman swims with killer whales in the wild.webm|thumb|[[Ingrid Visser (researcher)|Ingrid Visser]]'s research team filming orcas in New Zealand]]

Western attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as [[Moby Doll]], a resident harpooned off [[Saturna Island]] in 1964.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, non-aggressive whale who made no attempts to attack humans.{{sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=58–59}}

[[File:A73 whale transport.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 2002, the orphan [[Springer (orca)|Springer]] was successfully returned to her family.|alt=Killer whale wrapped in white cloth on a boat, surrounded by four people. A board braces its dorsal fin.]]
Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in [[Aquarium|aquaria]], and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by [[Michael Bigg]] led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through [[Wildlife photo-identification|photo-identification]] techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.{{sfn|Baird|2002|pp=73–80}}

Bigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=11}} In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.<ref name=Lyke/>

The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquarium. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film ''[[Free Willy]]'', the movie's captive star [[Keiko (whale)|Keiko]] was returned to the coast of his native [[Iceland]] in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the [[Earth Island Institute]], David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters.<ref name = Wood>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Daniel|title=Death of Sea World trainer: Do 'killer whales' belong in theme parks?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0224/Death-of-Sea-World-trainer-Do-killer-whales-belong-in-theme-parks|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  In 2002, the orphan [[Springer (orca)|Springer]] was discovered in [[Puget Sound]], Washington.

===Whaling===
{{Main|Whaling}}
[[File:Killer Whale (Old Tom) and whalers.jpeg|thumb|left|The killer whale named [[Old Tom (killer whale)|Old Tom]] swims alongside a [[whaleboat]], flanking a whale calf.

Two men are standing, the harpooner in the bow and a steersman on the aft rudder, while four oarsmen are seated.]]

The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global [[whaling]] industry caught immense numbers of [[Baleen whale|baleen]] and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of [[Whale oil|recoverable oil]], their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39}} Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s<ref>{{cite journal|year=1998|title=海域自然環境保全基礎調査 - 海棲動物調査報告書, (2)- 19. シャチ Orcinus orca (Limaeus,1758)マイルカ科|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/reports2/5th/kaisei_h10/5_kaisei_h10.pdf|page=54|journal=自然環境保全基礎調査|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>) and [[Norway]] took 987.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=34}} Extensive hunting of killer whales, including an [[Antarctic]] catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompted the [[International Whaling Commission]] to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=34}} Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although [[Indonesia]] and [[Greenland]] permit small subsistence hunts (see [[Aboriginal whaling]]). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in [[Akashi Strait]] and [[Harimanada]] being killed in the [[Seto Inland Sea]] in 1957,<ref name=OSAKACEA>{{cite web|publisher=OSAKA COLLEGE OF ECO & ANIMALS|year=2011|script-title=ja:シャチ騒動|url=http://cblog-eco.oca.ac.jp/blog/2011/10/post-aa1b.html|accessdate=December 24, 2014|language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Whale Laboratory of [[Shimonoseki]]|year=2014|title=Stranding Base (1901-2012) for Hyogo Prefecture|url=http://whalelab.org/HyogoPRF.htm|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into [[Tokyo Bay]] in 1970,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Whale Laboratory of [[Shimonoseki]]|year=2014|title=Stranding Date Base (1901-2012) for Chiba Prefecture|url=http://whalelab.org/ChibaPRF.htm|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.<ref name=SmallCetaceansChina /><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kaiya Z.|author2=Leatherwood S.|author3=Jefferson A.T. |year=2002 |title=Report of the Second Workshop on The Biology and Conservation of Small Cetaceans and Dugongs of South-East Asia |journal=CMS Technical Series Publication Nº 9 at Convention on Migratory Species |url=http://www.iucn-csg.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Perrinetal.0589.pdf |editor=Perrin F.W. |editor2=Reeves R.R. |editor3=Dolar L.L.M. |editor4=Jefferson A.T. |editor5=Marsh H. |editor6=Wang Y.J. |editor7=Estacion J. |accessdate=December 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045901/http://www.iucn-csg.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Perrinetal.0589.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

===Whale watching===
[[Whale watching]] continues to increase in popularity, but may have some problematic impacts on killer whales. Exposure to exhaust gasses from large amounts of vessel traffic are causing concern for the overall health of the 75 remaining Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKWs) left as of early 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bewhalewise.org/|title=Home|website=Be Whale Wise}}</ref> This population is followed by approximately 20 vessels for 12 hours a day during the months May–September.<ref name="Lachmuth et al 2011">{{cite journal |last1=Lachmuth |first1=Cara L. |last2=Barrett-Lennard |first2=Lance G. |last3=Steyn |first3=D.Q. |last4=Milsom |first4=William K. |title=Estimation of southern resident killer whale exposure to exhaust emissions from whale-watching vessels and potential adverse health effects and toxicity thresholds |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |date=April 2011 |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=792–805 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.01.002 |pmid=21276987 }}</ref> Researchers discovered that these vessels are in the line of sight for these whales for 98-99.5% of daylight hours.<ref name="Lachmuth et al 2011"/> With so many vessels, the air quality around these whales deteriorates and impacts their health. Air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome P450 1A gene family.<ref name="Lachmuth et al 2011"/> Researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales. A direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene. Vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems, with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility. A modelling study determined that the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of exhaust pollutants was about 12% of the human dose.<ref name="Lachmuth et al 2011"/>

As a response to this, in 2017 boats off the British Columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres. This new rule compliments Washington State's minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011. If a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes. The World Health Organization has set air quality standards in an effort to control the emissions produced by these vessels.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://baleinesendirect.org/en/boats-to-maintain-greater-distance-from-killer-whales/ |title = Boats to Maintain Greater Distance from Killer Whales &#124; Whales online|date = November 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Captivity===
{{Main|Captive killer whales}}
[[File:Miamiseaquariumlolita.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lolita (orca)|Lolita]], at the [[Miami Seaquarium]], is one of the oldest whales in captivity.|alt=A killer whale rises vertically above the pool surface, except its tail, with a trainer standing on its nose.]]
The killer whale's [[Animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and [[Marine mammal park|aquatic theme park]]s. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44}}

Organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.{{efn|Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.}} In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases.

A 2015 study coauthored by staff at [[SeaWorld]] and the [[Minnesota Zoo]] indicates that there is no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive killer whales.
